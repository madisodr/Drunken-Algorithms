# Drunken Algorithms
### Disclaimer
I did not write these while drinking.

## Introductions
Drunken Algorithms is a suite of algorithms implemented in C++. 

Many of these algorithms I was required to write or use throughout
my college career. Rewriting these over and over for classes, not
realizing I might need them again, seemed stupid. So, I decided to
just write, once and for all, a few source files with a bunch of
algorithms. Sorting, Selection, Path Finding and Graph Search, 
Data Structures such as Trees, among other things. Many of these
have counter parts already created in the standard library, not to
mention all the methods of sorting that are included, which all do
the same thing: sort a list. But knowing how things work instead 
of just expecting them to work is what being a programmer and 
engineer is all about.

This software is all open source. If any of this code is ever paid 
for then you either ripped someone off and/or got ripped off. I 
hold no responsibility in either case and you can see [LICENSE](LISCENSE)
for more information.

## Use
Just download and include the .cpp file you want to use in your source.

## School Use
If you are using this code for homework, feel free to not include my name
when you go to submit it. So long as it remains free. If you get caught
cheating, its not my problem and I don't want to hear about it. If your
submission wins a prize, I reserve the right to step forward and call you
a cheater and take the prize for myself. If you are a teacher and you
caught one of your students cheating using this code, I warned them.
